# SCAFFOLD WORKFLOW AGENT

## Purpose

This file defines how an AI tool scaffolds a full external ADAPT instance from a project document.

## Operating Model

* `ADAPT_FRAMEWORK` is read-only framework source.
* `PROJECT_FOLDER` is the actual project folder.
* `ADAPT_INSTANCE` is the project-specific ADAPT governance output.
* `START_HERE.md` is the launcher.
* This file is the scaffold workflow agent.
* `SCAFFOLD_OUTPUT_CONTRACT.md` defines required generated files.
* `WORKCELL_ONBOARDING_CONTRACT.md` defines onboarding behavior.
* `DEPLOYMENT_MODES.md` defines MODE_A and MODE_B scaffold behavior.
* `CANONICAL_STARTERS/` is the authoritative source for all starter file content.

Do not depend on tool-specific skills or product-specific agent features. Execute this contract using the file and document capabilities available in the current environment.

## Direct Scaffold Execution Rule

`Read and Execute START_HERE.md` is an execution command.

If the scaffold can safely resolve:

* `{{ADAPT_FRAMEWORK_PATH}}`
* `{{PROJECT_FOLDER_PATH}}`
* `{{ADAPT_INSTANCE_PATH}}`
* `{{PROJECT_DOCUMENT_PATH}}`

then it must proceed directly with:

`FULL_EXTERNAL_ADAPT_INSTANCE_SCAFFOLD`

Do not ask for another approval.
Do not ask the user to reply "Approved."
Do not convert scaffolding into a wizard.

Creating folders and files inside `{{ADAPT_INSTANCE_PATH}}` is part of scaffolding and does not require separate file-creation approval.

## No Wizard Rule

ADAPT scaffolding is not an installation wizard.

The command `Read and Execute START_HERE.md` is sufficient authorization to scaffold the external ADAPT instance.

The AI must not ask for a second approval before creating scaffold files inside `{{ADAPT_INSTANCE_PATH}}`.

The AI should infer safe defaults, proceed with scaffolding, record unresolved details as open questions/gaps, and stop with an initialization report.

Approval-style prompts are allowed only for unsafe conditions such as destructive overwrite, ambiguous paths, project source mutation, or unreadable/missing project documents.

## Required Inputs

Resolve these values before scaffolding:

* `{{ADAPT_FRAMEWORK_PATH}}`
* `{{PROJECT_FOLDER_PATH}}`
* `{{ADAPT_INSTANCE_PATH}}`
* `{{PROJECT_DOCUMENT_PATH}}`

Project source mutation defaults to:

`NO`

The launcher command supplies scaffold file-creation authorization for `{{ADAPT_INSTANCE_PATH}}`. File creation approval is not a separate required input.

## Path Resolution

Infer safe defaults before asking questions.

### ADAPT Framework Path

If `{{ADAPT_FRAMEWORK_PATH}}` is not provided, use the current directory containing `START_HERE.md`.

### Project Document Path

If `{{PROJECT_DOCUMENT_PATH}}` is not provided, search the ADAPT framework root for likely project documents with these extensions:

* `.docx`
* `.md`
* `.txt`
* `.pdf`

Prefer names that indicate project or business requirements, including:

* `Project`
* `Business`
* `Requirements`
* `Proposal`
* `Case`
* a product-specific or project-specific name

Exclude ADAPT framework contracts, launcher files, templates, guardrails, command drivers, framework reports, and other framework documentation.

If exactly one likely project document is found, use it.

If multiple likely documents are found, choose the most project-specific document only when the choice is obvious. If it is not obvious, stop and ask only for `{{PROJECT_DOCUMENT_PATH}}`.

The project name should be inferred from the resolved project document when its title or contents provide a reliable name. Do not invent a project name.

### Project Folder Path

If `{{PROJECT_FOLDER_PATH}}` is not provided, create or use a sibling folder beside the ADAPT framework folder:

`{{ADAPT_FRAMEWORK_PARENT}}/{{PROJECT_NAME}}_PROJECT`

If the project name cannot yet be inferred, use:

`{{ADAPT_FRAMEWORK_PARENT}}/PROJECT_FOLDER`

Do not create the project folder inside `ADAPT_FRAMEWORK` unless it already exists there and the user explicitly provided that path.

### ADAPT Instance Path

If `{{ADAPT_INSTANCE_PATH}}` is not provided, create or use a sibling folder beside the ADAPT framework folder:

`{{ADAPT_FRAMEWORK_PARENT}}/{{PROJECT_NAME}}_ADAPT_INSTANCE`

If the project name cannot yet be inferred, use:

`{{ADAPT_FRAMEWORK_PARENT}}/ADAPT_INSTANCE`

Do not create the ADAPT instance inside `PROJECT_FOLDER`.
Do not create the ADAPT instance inside `ADAPT_FRAMEWORK` unless the user explicitly provided that path.

## ADAPT Instance Target Handling

Creating the target directory and scaffold files is normal execution.

* If `{{ADAPT_INSTANCE_PATH}}` does not exist, create it and scaffold the full ADAPT instance.
* If it exists and is empty, scaffold into it.
* If it already contains an ADAPT instance, recover existing state and do not overwrite blindly.
* If it contains unrelated files, stop and ask for a different ADAPT instance path or whether to create a subfolder.

Recovery must preserve existing ADAPT state. Any destructive overwrite, deletion, replacement, or archival requires an explicit decision before proceeding.

## Deployment Mode Detection

Before scaffolding, detect which deployment mode applies. See `DEPLOYMENT_MODES.md` for full mode definitions.

```
If {{PROJECT_FOLDER_PATH}} exists AND contains application source files
(code files, solution files, build configs, or existing documentation):
→ MODE_A: EXISTING_SOLUTION

If {{PROJECT_FOLDER_PATH}} does not exist, OR contains no source files,
OR only a project document is the input with no existing codebase:
→ MODE_B: REQUIREMENTS_ONLY
```

Record the detected mode in `PROJECT_CONTROL_PLANE.md` under `DeploymentMode` before completing scaffolding.

## Workflow

1. Locate `START_HERE.md` and resolve `{{ADAPT_FRAMEWORK_PATH}}`.
2. Infer `{{PROJECT_DOCUMENT_PATH}}`, `{{PROJECT_NAME}}`, `{{PROJECT_FOLDER_PATH}}`, and `{{ADAPT_INSTANCE_PATH}}` using the path resolution rules.
3. Validate that the resolved paths satisfy the placement and target-folder safety rules.
4. Read `START_HERE.md`.
5. Read `SCAFFOLD_WORKFLOW_AGENT.md`.
6. Read `SCAFFOLD_OUTPUT_CONTRACT.md`.
7. Read `WORKCELL_ONBOARDING_CONTRACT.md`.
8. Read `DEPLOYMENT_MODES.md`.
9. Detect deployment mode (MODE_A or MODE_B) using the detection logic above.
10. If MODE_A: run the read-only discovery pass defined in `DEPLOYMENT_MODES.md` before proceeding.
11. Read the resolved project document.
12. Extract source truth.
13. Infer project shape.
14. Create or recover the full external ADAPT instance using canonical starters (see Canonical Starters section below).
15. Populate starter artifacts required by the scaffold output contract.
16. Record missing details as open questions and gaps.
17. Do not create real workcells unless onboarding commands were provided.
18. Keep project source mutation at `NO` unless the user explicitly requested a clear project shell or source mutation scope.
19. Record `DeploymentMode` in `PROJECT_CONTROL_PLANE.md`.
20. Produce the ADAPT Startup / Initialization Report.
21. Stop.

Do not pause between path resolution and scaffold creation merely to request approval.

## Canonical Starters

`ADAPT_FRAMEWORK/CANONICAL_STARTERS/` is the authoritative source for all starter file content.

### Copy, Do Not Generate

The scaffold must copy each required file from `ADAPT_FRAMEWORK/CANONICAL_STARTERS/` into the `{{ADAPT_INSTANCE_PATH}}` rather than generating starter file content from AI training knowledge.

The canonical starters mirror the ADAPT instance folder structure. For each required file listed in `SCAFFOLD_OUTPUT_CONTRACT.md`, locate the corresponding file in `CANONICAL_STARTERS/` and copy it to the target path.

### Populate After Copying

After copying, populate project-specific values (project name, team names, requirements, decisions) into the copied files using only:

* The resolved project document (promoted or pending promotion)
* Other explicitly accepted source truth
* Discovered facts (for MODE_A only)

Do not invent project-specific content to fill placeholders. Record unfilled facts as open questions or gaps.

### Missing Canonical Starters

If a canonical starter file does not exist for a required output file, the AI must:

1. Report `CANONICAL_STARTER_MISSING: {{FILE_NAME}}` for that file in the initialization report.
2. Generate a best-effort version of the file using ADAPT governance principles.
3. Mark the generated file with `GENERATED_FROM_TRAINING_KNOWLEDGE: YES` at the top.
4. Flag it clearly in the initialization report.

## Source Truth Extraction

Extract:

* project name
* domain summary
* users
* workflows
* business rules
* requirements
* acceptance criteria
* risks
* non-goals
* open questions
* suggested modules
* validation concerns
* integration concerns

Do not invent missing content.

## Missing Details Handling

Missing language, framework, database, auth, deployment, team names, and first milestone must not block scaffolding.

Record unresolved details in:

* `OPEN_QUESTIONS.md`
* `GAP_REGISTER.md`

Use:

* `GAP-T10 Decision Gap`
* `GAP-T11 Context Gap`

## Project Source Mutation Policy

Project source mutation defaults to `NO`.

If the user did not explicitly request project shell creation or project source mutation:

* do not modify `{{PROJECT_FOLDER_PATH}}`
* write normal scaffold output only to `{{ADAPT_INSTANCE_PATH}}`
* report project files touched as none

Project shell creation is allowed only when project source mutation is explicitly authorized as `YES` and its scope is clear.

If authorized, shell creation must be limited to:

* solution shell
* frontend shell
* backend shell
* README files
* placeholder contracts
* placeholder docs
* placeholder test folders

Forbidden:

* real business logic
* secrets
* cloud resources
* production auth
* database persistence
* payment/chat/GPS/live-map implementation

Do not edit existing project source unless the explicit authorization covers those files.

## Valid Stop Conditions

Stop only when safe execution is not possible:

* `START_HERE.md` cannot be found.
* `SCAFFOLD_WORKFLOW_AGENT.md`, `SCAFFOLD_OUTPUT_CONTRACT.md`, or `WORKCELL_ONBOARDING_CONTRACT.md` cannot be found.
* No project document can be resolved.
* Multiple project document candidates exist and no obvious choice exists.
* The ADAPT instance path points inside the project folder without an explicit user-provided path.
* The ADAPT instance path points inside the framework folder without an explicit user-provided path.
* The ADAPT instance target contains unrelated files.
* Project source mutation is requested but its scope is unclear.
* Destructive overwrite, deletion, or archival is required.
* The project document cannot be read.
* Required scaffold output cannot be written.

Do not stop merely to ask for approval to create scaffold files inside `{{ADAPT_INSTANCE_PATH}}`.

## Required Final Report

After scaffolding, output:

# ADAPT Startup / Initialization Report

Include:

* framework source path
* project folder path
* ADAPT instance path
* project document path
* inferred project name
* deployment mode detected (MODE_A_EXISTING_SOLUTION or MODE_B_REQUIREMENTS_ONLY)
* source truth status
* canonical starters used (count)
* canonical starters missing (list, if any)
* folders created
* files created
* project files touched
* open questions recorded
* gaps created
* blockers created
* next recommended command
* status

Next recommended command:

`Run Director intake`

## Stop Rule

After scaffold initialization and the final report, stop.
