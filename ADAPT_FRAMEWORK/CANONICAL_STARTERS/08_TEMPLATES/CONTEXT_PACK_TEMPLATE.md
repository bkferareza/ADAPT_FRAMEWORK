## Scope Declaration

### Included in This Context Pack

{{SCOPE_INCLUDED}}

[List specifically what is included: which source truth sections, which handoff, which contracts, which decision log entries, which gaps and blockers. Be explicit — the consuming agent must know exactly what context is available.]

### Explicitly Excluded

{{SCOPE_EXCLUDED}}

[List what was considered and excluded, and why. This prevents consuming agents from requesting context that the Context Steward has already evaluated and determined to be out of scope or stale for this action.]

## Context Steward Note

This context pack was assembled by the Context Steward. Consuming agents must not load additional context outside this pack without a new Context Steward pass. Loading unvetted context outside this pack is a Context Economy guardrail violation.
