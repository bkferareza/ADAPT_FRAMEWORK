## You are running ADAPT Atomic Handoff Dispatch.

This is the master entry point for any ADAPT session. Read this document fully before taking any action. Every ADAPT execution — regardless of role, lane, or command — follows the Atomic Handoff Dispatch protocol defined here.

---

## The 13-Step Atomic Handoff Dispatch Sequence

Every ADAPT run executes exactly these steps in order. No step may be skipped. No step may be repeated unless an error in a prior step is discovered and corrected before continuing.

**Step 1 — Recover current state (read control plane)**
Read `ADAPT/02_DIRECTOR_LANE/PROJECT_CONTROL_PLANE.md` in full. Record the values of: `CurrentPhase`, `ExecutionReadiness`, `ActiveMilestone`, `ActiveHandoff`, `CurrentAuthority`, `Blocked`, `ActiveBlockers`, `ActiveGaps`, `NextExpectedAction`, `SourceTruthVersion`.
If the control plane is missing or unreadable, stop and report: no ADAPT instance is active or the instance is corrupted.

**Step 2 — Locate active handoff or control plane directive**
Find the active handoff file referenced in `ActiveHandoff`. If `ActiveHandoff = NONE`, check `NextExpectedAction` for Director routing. If neither is present, stop and report that there is no active handoff and no expected action. Do not invent work.

**Step 3 — Validate authority**
Confirm that the current agent identity or lane matches `CurrentAuthority` in the control plane. If there is a mismatch, stop immediately and route to the Director Lane. Do not proceed as a different authority.

**Step 4 — Estimate job size**
Read the active handoff and scope contract to estimate the size of the next bounded action using the Context Budget Policy tiers: XS / S / M / L / XL. If the job is XL and no Director or human approval is on record, stop and request approval before assembling the context pack.

**Step 5 — Compute minimum safe context**
Determine which artifacts are required for safe execution of the active handoff. Use only artifacts referenced in: the active handoff, the scope contract, the active source truth version, and accepted decisions in DECISION_LOG.md. Do not include historical handoffs, superseded versions, or artifacts not referenced by the active task.

**Step 6 — Generate or attach Context Pack**
If a current context pack (CP-ID) exists and is not stale (check `LastContextDelta` vs. context pack date), attach it. If no current pack exists or the pack is stale, invoke the Context Steward to generate a new context pack. Do not proceed without a valid context pack for non-trivial actions.

**Step 7 — Decide: execute, split, block, or route**
Based on the context pack, the scope contract, and the active handoff:
- **Execute**: if the action is bounded, authorized, and fits within the scope contract.
- **Split**: if the action is too large to complete atomically; split into smaller handoffs and emit the first one.
- **Block**: if a dependency, gap, or missing authority prevents progress; record a blocker and route to Director.
- **Route**: if the action belongs to a different lane or workcell; emit a routing handoff to the correct authority.

**Step 8 — Execute only if authorized and atomic**
Execute the single bounded action assigned by the active handoff. Do not continue into adjacent tasks. Do not make decisions beyond the handoff scope. Do not mutate any file outside the mutation authority defined in the scope contract.

**Step 9 — Produce evidence**
After completing the action, record all evidence required by the role (per EVIDENCE_STANDARD_BY_ROLE.md). Evidence must be specific, artifact-referenced, and sufficient for an independent reviewer to verify the work. Claims without artifact references are not accepted as evidence.

**Step 10 — Produce Context Delta**
Record all state changes that resulted from this action in a Context Delta artifact (CD-ID). The context delta must list: what changed, what files were affected, what new IDs were created, and what downstream artifacts may need to be refreshed.

**Step 11 — Emit next handoff**
Create the next handoff artifact addressed to the appropriate lane or workcell. The handoff must include: the action completed, evidence references, unresolved items, and the next required action. Update `ActiveHandoff` in the control plane to the new handoff ID/path.

**Step 12 — Update control plane**
Update the following control plane fields:
- `LastAction`: description of the completed action with artifact reference
- `LastContextDelta`: the CD-ID just produced
- `NextExpectedAction`: what the next agent should do
- `ActiveHandoff`: new handoff ID/path
- `ActiveWorkcell`: update if authority changes
- `Blocked`, `ActiveBlockers`, `ActiveGaps`: update if new blockers or gaps were created
- `CurrentPhase`, `ExecutionReadiness`: update if the phase or readiness changed

**Step 13 — Stop**
Do not continue past Step 12. Do not begin the next action. Do not process the next handoff. The current Atomic Handoff Dispatch cycle is complete. The next agent reads the control plane and begins a new cycle.

## Pre-Execution Checklist

Before beginning Step 8 (Execute), confirm all of the following:

- [ ] Control plane has been read (Step 1 complete)
- [ ] Active handoff has been located and is readable (Step 2 complete)
- [ ] Current authority matches `CurrentAuthority` in the control plane (Step 3 complete)
- [ ] Guardrail checks have been run — no STOP_REQUIRED returned
- [ ] Job size has been estimated (Step 4 complete)
- [ ] Context pack is assembled and current (Steps 5-6 complete)
- [ ] Action is within mutation authority defined in scope contract
- [ ] No human approval gate is pending

If any item is unchecked, stop and address it before executing.

---

## Execution Rules

1. **Execute exactly one bounded move.** The active handoff defines the scope. Do not do more.
2. **Produce evidence.** Every completed action requires reviewable artifacts.
3. **Produce a context delta.** Every state change must be recorded.
4. **Emit the next handoff.** The next agent must have an instruction to consume.
5. **Update the control plane.** State must be consistent before stopping.
6. **STOP after Step 13.** Do not continue into the next handoff or task.

## How to Determine Which Lane or Role to Activate

1. Read the control plane (`PROJECT_CONTROL_PLANE.md`).
2. Read `CurrentAuthority` — this is the active lane or workcell.
3. Read `ActiveHandoff` — this is the task instruction for the active authority.
4. Identify the target lane or role from `ActiveHandoff` header or routing field.
5. Load the role-specific action prompt:
   - Director Lane → `ACTION_PROMPT_DIRECTOR.md`
   - Context Steward → `ACTION_PROMPT_CONTEXT_STEWARD.md`
   - Onboarding → `ACTION_PROMPT_ONBOARDING.md`
   - Planning → `ACTION_PROMPT_PLANNING.md`
   - Generic Workcell → `ACTION_PROMPT_WORKCELL.md`
   - Integrator → `ACTION_PROMPT_INTEGRATOR.md`
   - QA → `ACTION_PROMPT_QA.md`
   - Janitor → `ACTION_PROMPT_JANITOR.md`
   - Challenge Lane → `ACTION_PROMPT_CHALLENGE.md`
6. Follow the role-specific action prompt from Step 1 of its Atomic Handoff Dispatch sequence.

## Universal Forbidden Actions

The following actions are forbidden for ALL agents in ALL roles. Performing any of these is a GOVERNANCE_VIOLATION. Record the violation, stop, and route to the Director.

| # | Forbidden Action | Violation Type |
|---|-----------------|----------------|
| 1 | Broad uncontrolled execution across multiple lanes in a single session | SCOPE_VIOLATION |
| 2 | Source code mutation without explicit workcell authority (scope contract with mutation permission) | MUTATION_VIOLATION |
| 3 | Director-role agents writing or modifying application source code | GOVERNANCE_VIOLATION |
| 4 | Assuming or inventing source truth when it has not been promoted | SOURCE_TRUTH_VIOLATION (record as GAP-T11) |
| 5 | Using Memory Bank as live authority for current project state | CONTEXT_VIOLATION |
| 6 | Treating developer self-validation as QA signoff | INDEPENDENCE_VIOLATION |
| 7 | Continuing past the next handoff emission without stopping | DISPATCH_VIOLATION |
| 8 | Starting work without an active handoff or Director routing | AUTHORITY_VIOLATION |
| 9 | Skipping evidence production for a completed action | EVIDENCE_VIOLATION |
| 10 | Overriding a guardrail STOP_REQUIRED signal without human approval | GUARDRAIL_VIOLATION |
| 11 | Marking a blocker as resolved without documented evidence of resolution | BLOCKER_VIOLATION |
| 12 | Performing QA validation on work you developed in the same session | INDEPENDENCE_VIOLATION |

## Universal Stop Conditions

Stop immediately and do not continue if any of the following are true:

1. No valid authority for the current action (no active handoff; `CurrentAuthority` mismatch)
2. Multiple active handoffs exist for the same work item — route to Director for disambiguation
3. Source truth required but not promoted — record GAP-T11, route to Director
4. Context pack missing or insufficient for a non-trivial action — request Context Steward
5. Action would go outside the workcell's scope contract — record blocker, route to Director
6. Mutation authority missing for a file that must be changed — record blocker, route to Director
7. Director-role action would write to application source code — report GOVERNANCE_VIOLATION
8. QA validation requested but no READY_FOR_TEST acceptance criteria exist — record GAP-T12, route to Director
9. Implementation task has no registered workcell owner — record gap, route to Director
10. Action would complete but produces no reviewable evidence — record blocker
11. Implementation contradicts an accepted requirement — report conflict, route to Director
12. Any guardrail returns STOP_REQUIRED — record the specific guardrail and condition
13. Human approval gate not cleared — stop and request approval
14. Control plane is inconsistent (e.g., `Blocked=YES` but no blockers in register) — report to Director

See `STOP_RULES.md` for the complete definitions of each stop condition.
