# MUTATION_PERMISSION_MATRIX.md
STATUS: DRAFT

## Purpose
Defines exactly what each ADAPT role may and may not write, modify, or create. Every agent must check this matrix before taking any action that modifies an artifact. "NO" is an absolute prohibition. "LIMITED" requires reading the notes section for the specific constraint.

## Notes for LIMITED Entries

### Director Lane — Can mutate source truth? — LIMITED
The Director Lane may promote a source truth version and record it in SOURCE_TRUTH_VERSION_LOG.md. This requires human approval before the promotion record is written. The Director Lane may NOT modify the content of the source truth document itself. Content modifications require a new version, human approval, and re-extraction.

### Integrator Workcell — Can mutate ADAPT control artifacts? — LIMITED
The Integrator may update: API_CONTRACTS.md (reconciliation records), HANDOFF_LOG.md (its own log), EVIDENCE_REGISTER.md (its own), CONTEXT_DELTA_LOG.md (its own). The Integrator may NOT update: PROJECT_CONTROL_PLANE.md (Director only), ACCEPTED_WORK_REGISTER.md (Director only), DECISION_LOG.md (Director only).

### Integrator Workcell — Can mutate application source code? — LIMITED
The Integrator may make narrowly scoped reconciliation changes that both the backend and frontend workcells have agreed to in writing (recorded in the reconciliation report). The Integrator must not rewrite feature logic, change business rules, or modify code outside the agreed reconciliation scope. Any reconciliation change that affects more than the agreed scope must be routed to the responsible workcell via Director.

### Integrator Workcell — Can mutate pipeline/config? — LIMITED
The Integrator may update CI/CD pipeline configuration when build failures are identified during integration review AND the specific configuration change is within the integration scope defined in its SCOPE_CONTRACT.md. Pipeline changes that affect production deployment configuration require Director and human approval.

### Backend Workcell — Can mutate ADAPT control artifacts? — LIMITED
The Backend Workcell may update: HANDOFF_LOG.md (its own), EVIDENCE_REGISTER.md (its own), CONTEXT_DELTA_LOG.md (its own), GAP_LOG.md (its own), BLOCKER_LOG.md (its own), WORK_LOG.md (its own). The Backend Workcell may NOT update: PROJECT_CONTROL_PLANE.md, ACCEPTED_WORK_REGISTER.md, DECISION_LOG.md, WORKCELL_REGISTRY.md, LANE_ASSIGNMENT_MATRIX.md.

### Backend Workcell — Can mutate tests? — LIMITED
The Backend Workcell may write unit tests and integration tests for the server-side logic it is implementing, within its SCOPE_CONTRACT.md mutation authority. It may NOT write or modify QA acceptance tests or QA test plans — those belong to the QA Workcell.

### Backend Workcell — Can mutate pipeline/config? — LIMITED
The Backend Workcell may modify pipeline configuration files explicitly listed in its SCOPE_CONTRACT.md mutation authority (e.g., environment variable definitions for backend services, migration runner configuration). It may NOT modify the overall CI/CD deployment pipeline, shared build steps, or frontend pipeline configuration.

### Frontend Workcell — Can mutate ADAPT control artifacts? — LIMITED
Same as Backend Workcell. The Frontend Workcell may update only its own workcell-scoped ADAPT logs (HANDOFF_LOG.md, EVIDENCE_REGISTER.md, CONTEXT_DELTA_LOG.md, GAP_LOG.md, BLOCKER_LOG.md, WORK_LOG.md).

### Frontend Workcell — Can mutate tests? — LIMITED
The Frontend Workcell may write component tests and frontend integration tests for the UI logic it is implementing, within its SCOPE_CONTRACT.md mutation authority. It may NOT write or modify QA acceptance tests or QA test plans.

### Frontend Workcell — Can mutate pipeline/config? — LIMITED
The Frontend Workcell may modify pipeline configuration files explicitly listed in its SCOPE_CONTRACT.md mutation authority (e.g., frontend build scripts, asset pipeline configuration). Same restrictions as Backend Workcell for shared and deployment pipeline steps.

### QA Workcell — Can mutate ADAPT control artifacts? — LIMITED
The QA Workcell may update: HANDOFF_LOG.md (its own), EVIDENCE_REGISTER.md (its own), CONTEXT_DELTA_LOG.md (its own), DEFECT_REGISTER.md (creating defect records). It may NOT update: PROJECT_CONTROL_PLANE.md, ACCEPTED_WORK_REGISTER.md, DECISION_LOG.md, WORKCELL_REGISTRY.md. QA signoff is recorded in SIGNOFF_REGISTER.md — the QA Workcell creates this record (its own signoff record), but certification in ACCEPTED_WORK_REGISTER.md is created by the Director Lane.

### Planning Orchestrator — Can mutate ADAPT control artifacts? — LIMITED
The Planning Orchestrator may update: WORKCELL_ROADMAPS.md, DEPENDENCY_MAP.md, and its own planning artifacts (milestone briefs, work package lists). It may NOT update: PROJECT_CONTROL_PLANE.md directly (all control plane updates go through the Director), ACCEPTED_WORK_REGISTER.md, DECISION_LOG.md (Director records plan approvals), LANE_ASSIGNMENT_MATRIX.md (Director assigns after plan approval).

### Context Steward — Can mutate ADAPT control artifacts? — LIMITED
The Context Steward may update: `LastContextDelta` field in PROJECT_CONTROL_PLANE.md (this specific field only), context pack artifacts (CP-IDs in the context pack folder), staleness records. It may NOT update: any governance register, accepted work records, decision log, or source truth.

### Janitor — Can mutate ADAPT control artifacts? — LIMITED
The Janitor may: move consumed handoffs from ACTIVE/ to ARCHIVE/ (adding archive header only), compact resolved register entries (summarize in-place without deleting original IDs and resolution status). The Janitor may NOT: delete any record, modify accepted work records, modify decision log content, or alter any active artifact. All Janitor mutations are archive or compaction only.

## Absolute Prohibitions (All Roles)

Regardless of role, the following are prohibited for all AI agents:

| Prohibition | Applies To |
|-------------|-----------|
| Writing to application source code without active workcell authority and SCOPE_CONTRACT.md mutation permission | All roles except Backend/Frontend/Integrator Workcells within scope |
| Modifying ACCEPTED_WORK_REGISTER.md content (append-only) | All roles — Director may append; no role may modify existing entries |
| Modifying DECISION_LOG.md content (append-only) | All roles — Director may append; no role may modify existing entries |
| Promoting source truth without human approval | All roles |
| Producing QA signoff without QA independence | All roles except QA Workcell under independence requirement |
| Certifying accepted work without evidence review | All roles — this is Director Certification Agent authority only |
